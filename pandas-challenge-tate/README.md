## Overview

**This is a _three-part_ homework assignment.**

You will work in random pairs to complete this task. 

See the Part-1, Part-2, and Part-3 folders for the assignment details. All three parts are required for submission.

* Part-1 is a mini-project. You should work with your randomly assigned partner to complete this. *Both tasks in this section are required.* You should also work with your partner on this part.
* Part-2 is an analysis task. You and your partner should work together and analyze the code components in each cell. Your task will be to describe what is happening in each code block in clear and easy to understand language. Also, be sure to address any specific prompts that are asked. *All four tasks in this section are required.* Work with your partner on this task, but *write up the analysis of the code **in your own words**. You and your partner should not have the exact same write up for each code segment.*
* Part-3 contains two analysis cases. *Both tasks in this section are required.* Collaborate closely with your partner on this, especially the PyCitySchools task.

**All three parts are required for your Python homework submission.**
