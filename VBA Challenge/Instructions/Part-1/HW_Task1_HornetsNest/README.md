# Hornets Nest

## Instructions

* Create a VBA script to handle the growing Hornet infestation in your spreadsheet.

  * Write a macro that will replace any Hornets with Bugs (keep in mind that you should have a limited supply of bugs)
  * If you run out of bugs, then replace the remaining hornets with Bees (you also have a limited supply of bees) available to replace the Hornets
  * If you run out of Bugs or Bees provide the user with the message: "Oh no! We still have hornets..."
  * Count the number of Hornets found and display the number to your user in the form of a message box.

## Hints

* You may want to create a backup of your spreadsheet as your macro will write over the contents.

* _Also, refer to the class videos if you need help  because I have purposefully removed the solution_
